code for analysing the financial records of a company

JavaScript code that analyses the records to calculate each of the following:

The total number of months included in the dataset.

The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

You will need to track what the total change in profits is from month to month and then find the average.

> (Total/(Number of months - 1))

The greatest increase in profits (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.

The greatest decrease in losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.

When you open your code in the browser your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:
